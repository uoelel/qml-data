## Help us!

In an effort to improve the Equality, Diversity and Inclusiveness (EDI) of this collection, I am looking for data tables on minoritised and Global South languages and from research by minoritised researchers.

If you have or know of data that qualifies, feel free to get in touch with me (Stefano) at [s.coretta\@ed.ac.uk](mailto:s.coretta@ed.ac.uk){.email}.

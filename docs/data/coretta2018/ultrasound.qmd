    abstract: |
      Over a century of phonetic research has established the cross-linguistic existence of the so called “voicing effect”, by which vowels tend to be shorter when followed by voiceless stops and longer when the following stop is voiced. However, no agreement is found among scholars regarding the source of this effect, and several causal accounts have been advanced. A notable one is the compensatory temporal adjustment account, according to which the duration of the vowel is inversely correlated with the stop closure duration (voiceless stops having longer closure durations than voiced stops). The compensatory account has been criticised due to lack of empirical support and its vagueness regarding the temporal interval within which compensation is implemented. The results from an exploratory study of Italian and Polish suggest that the duration of the interval between two consecutive stop releases in CVCV words in these languages is not affected by the voicing of the second stop. The durational difference of the first vowel and the stop closure would then follow from differences in timing of the VC boundary within this interval. While other aspects, like production mechanisms related to laryngeal features effects and perceptual biases cannot be ruled out, the data discussed here are compatible with a production account based on compensatory mechanisms.

## Description

The folder `coretta2018/ultrasound/` contains files exported from Articulate Assistant Advanced with spline data from ultrasound tongue imaging of Italian and Polish speakers.

There are two files per speaker:

-   The `*-tongue-cart.tsv` file has spline data taken at specific time points.

-   The `*-vowel-series.tsv` file has spline data from within the duration of the target vowel segment.

## Variables in `*-tongue-cart.tsv`

`speaker`

:   speaker's ID

`rec_date`

:   date and time of recording

`prompt`

:   sentence stimulus

`label`

:   annotation label

`TT_displacement_sm`

:   tongue tip displacement position (smoothed) in mm

`TT_velocity`

:   tongue tip velocity

`TT_velocity_abs`

:   tongue tip absolute velocity

`TD_displacement_sm`

:   tongue dorsum displacement position (smoothed) in mm

`TD_velocity`

:   tongue dorsum velocity

`TD_velocity_abs`

:   tongue dorsum absolute velocity

`TR_displacement_sm`

:   tongue root displacement position (smoothed) in mm

`TR_velocity`

:   tongue root velocity

`TR_velocity_abs`

:   tongue root absolute velocity

The remaining columns are the X and Y coordinates of the spline along the 42 fan lines (X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2, ..., X_42, Y_42)
